    <h1>Kevine's summary of what she learnt in Quality Assurance</h1>
    <img src="https://wp.testbytes.net//wp-content/uploads/2019/04/quality-assurance-1.png" id="image">
    <p> In quality Assurance we learnt that before the product is launched at the market it should first meet the required standards and the QA is the one who confirms if the product meets the required standards.
    we learnt different stages the product goes through before being a final product;
