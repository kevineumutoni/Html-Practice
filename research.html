    <p> In UX research we learnt that user experience research, is a systematic study of how users interact with a product or service. It's used to design products and services that meet user needs.  we learnt that they are different methods of doing research which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
       
        <li> Qualitative research: It involves data not in numbers </li>
        <li>Quantitative research: It involves numbers</li>
        <li>Primary research: It is done on the field interacting directly with users</li>
        <li>Secondary research: It is collected from the previous research data.</li>
        
        
    </ul>
    <p>My trainer was <b>Brian </b> in UX research</p>
