    <p> In UX design we learnt that User experience (UX) design is the process of creating products that are easy and enjoyable to use. It involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and abilities. UX design is a multidisciplinary field that combines psychology, business, design, and technology. 
        Our trainer told us that sometimes you design what people doesn't like so you must be a good designer and to be a good designer doesn't have to be a good artist. Below is a list of what I learned in my class.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned that a good design will always attract the consumers </li>
        <li>I have learned that design is the first step before you build a prototype.</li>
        <li>I have learned that in design you just have to be creative, on what you want to do and as well putting users in mind</li>
        <li>I have learned design principles and elements</li>
        <li>I have learned that I can be a best designer I want to</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>My trainer was Eric in UX Design</p>
