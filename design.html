    <h1>Kevine's summary of what she learnt in UX Design</h1>

    <p> In UX design we learnt that User experience (UX) design is the process of creating products that are easy and enjoyable to use. It involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and abilities. UX design is a multidisciplinary field that combines psychology, business, design, and technology. 
        Our trainer told us that sometimes you design what people doesn't like so you must be a good designer and to be a good designer doesn't have to be a good artist.

    <p>My trainer was Eric in UX Design</p>
