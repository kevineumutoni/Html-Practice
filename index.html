    <h1> Kevine UMUTONI an AkiraChix student </h1>

    <p>My name is Kevine Umutoni, I am 20 years old, I am an AkiraChix student in Lovelace class,  I aspire to be a top graduate in November 2025. And I want to share what I learned in class in my 27 days experience at AkiraChix organisation based in Kenya Nairobi. </p>
    <h3>Here's a summary of what I have learnt in my class</h3>
    <p>Here's a list of what I have learned in class and once you <span>click on each class mentioned below with an underline</span> you will find more details;</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <a href="web.html"  id="web">Web Front-end </a> </li>
        <li><a href="mobile.html" id="mobile"> Front-end</a></li>
        <li><a href="quality.html" >  Qualityassurance</a></li>
        <li> <a href="research.html">UX research </a></li>
        <li><a href="design.html"> UX design </a></li>
        <li>Product management</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Generally I have learned a lot, I have learned the power of using your time well, Doing research before time, I love when a trainer ask a question and am able to answer it
    because I read the bit of what we will learn; I love it so much, and when I trainer says "Good job Kevine"  it makes me very very happy. 
    I have also learned to research well and be able to go beyond of what we learned in class because 80% of what we learn must be derived from the research you made by yourself. I want to graduate and be very rich.
    </p>
    <h4>I want to be more active in class and ask more questions, so that the trainer will leave when I understood the concept.</h4>
