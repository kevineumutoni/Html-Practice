    <h1>Kevine's summary of what she learnt in Front-end</h1>
    <img src="https://www.etatvasoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mobile-app-development-methodologies.jpg" id="image">
    <p> In Front-end (mobile) I learnt many things but most necessarily I learnt that Front-end is what the user interacts with, what the user see when they open their mobile phones
        We use mostly Kotlin, Flutter and JavaScript most of the time to build front-end which is what a user interacts with. But in our class we only use Kotlin and I am going to explain what I learned;
    </p>
    <ul>
       
        <li> We uses Kotlin programming language to create front-end which is the one the user will interact with </li>
        <li>I learned that in Kotlin we use Intellij as an IDE</li>
        <li>I learned that in future we will use Android studio, to build our app</li>
        <li>I learned that Kotlin language is based on Java</li>
        <li>I have learned not to just merge a request just open a pull request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My trainer was <b>James </b> in front-end mobile</p>
