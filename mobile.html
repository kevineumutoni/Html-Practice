    <h1>Kevine's summary of what she learnt in Front-end</h1>
    <img src="https://www.etatvasoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/mobile-app-development-methodologies.jpg" id="image">
    <p> In Front-end (mobile) I learnt many things but most necessarily I learnt that Front-end is what the user interacts with, what the user see when they open their mobile phones
        We use mostly Kotlin, Dart and JavaScript most of the time to build front-end which is what a user interacts with. But in our class we only use Kotlin
    </p>
    <ul>
       
        <li> We uses Kotlin programming language to create front-end which is the one the user will interact with </li>
    </ul>
    <p>My trainer was James in front-end mobile</p>
