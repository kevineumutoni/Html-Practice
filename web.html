    <h1>Kevine's summary of what she learnt in Front-end</h1>
    <img src="https://gracethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-img.png" id="image">
    <p> In Front-end (web) I learnt many things but most necessarily I learnt that Front-end is what the user interacts with, what the user see when they open their browser
        We use mostly HTML, CSS and JavaScript most of the time to build front-end which is what a user interacts with. I am gonna explain the purpose of each language we use.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We use HTML to write web pages</li>
        <li>We use CSS to style the web page</li>
        <li> And we use JavaScript to give us the web functionality</li>
        <li>We learned  how to tables and forms</li>
        <li>We learned how to navigate through the terminal and use the commands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My trainer was Hunter in front-end web</p>
